Question 1: In question 1, in order to to allow the type of “features” as a generic input parameter, I am using Commandline parsing. Please
    find the example of 1 such command as follow :
    python VDMS.py hourly
    In order to get output for different features, change the last argument of given commandline and corresponding output will come.
    If you put argument that is not from the features in the given URL, error message will be generated.


Question 2: In this question, I am passing range(to be scanned) of IP addresses as String and excluded IP addresses as list through commandline.
    If subnet is greater than 32, appropriate error message is displayed. I am also displaying the Excluded IPs, Out of range IPs and Scanned IPs.
    Example of command to run this file:
    python VDMS_2.py 256.168.0.1/24 192.168.0.1,192.168.1.1,19.168.3.1,192.168.1.2,192.168.0.2,192.168.0.3,192.168.0.4
